# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Datacamp project

#### Project task
1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
- Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
- Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
- A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
  + Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
  + Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
  + Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
  + Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
- A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
- A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
- An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
- A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
2. Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode.
